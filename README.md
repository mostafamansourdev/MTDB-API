# MTDB API

This will be the rethinking of my first real project i built.
I will focus on rebuilding the Backend and database.
In version 1 i built it with firebase as backend and React.js as the Front-end.
I Focused on the front-end not the back end the app works but the core feature are broken.

lets start….

I will document my Journey on notion you can follow with me at this link [MTDB V2 Journey](https://www.notion.so/MTDB-V2-2f9a80ae708080e08767c0a89cb68c54?source=copy_link)
